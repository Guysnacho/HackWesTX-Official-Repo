            Most definitely! We're working behind the scenes to update the site
            to something more recent and functional. Hopefully with QR codes and
            on-site interactions. ðŸ˜Œ

          <p class="questions">What's a hackathon?</p>
          <p>
            Hackathons are usually software or hardware development events where
            many hackers and innovators come together to collaborate and have
            fun!

            You are able to register for HackWesTX without a team, but
            collaborating with a few friends or new faces will definitely make
            the experience more enjoyable!

          <p class="questions">Will there be free stuff?</p>

            Of course! All participants will be well fed and provided with ample
            amounts of swag!
